	<h2>What I Learned Today 6/27/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>Some similarities between Python and Scratch is the use of Varibles, Boleens,
				Integers, Floats, and Strings. Some differences is that in Python syntax 
				and indentation are very crucial to the coding process, but when doing 
			scratch, its only drag and drop with variables that you would want to use. </li>
			<li>I mainly just likes when my things worked correctly. It wasnt really hard, just very time consuming. </li>
      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 6/30/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>A list in python is a way to organize things as well as making it easier for people to capture information and display it. </li>
			<li>During my time coding today, I did have to debug a lot of different problems
				and it felt quite annoying that I couldn't really pinpoint the causes of errors quickly. </li>
      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/5/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> Something that makes me nervous about the future of robots is that they're starting to be more independent with what actions
				that they do and i'm just wondering how much more independent they will get and what functions they will be able to do without
				human input.</li>
      		</ul>
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/6/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> Both Manuela Veluso and Ayanna Howard both went to Georgia Tech. The Basic part of the Arduino sketch would be the power,
			ground, resistor, and the LED light.</li>
      		</ul>		
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/10/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>I already had previous knowledge of circuits before starting these projects so i didn't really learn anything new, but it 
				was a nice refresher when we got to go over everything all over again.  </li>
			<li>My favorite part of the dance was making it kind of go with the song and just choosing what the robot did overall.  </li>
			<li> The kind of outputs that Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need both analog digital outputs for their robots. </li>
      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/12/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>A few things that i learned was that there are a lot of different senses that robots can use to get out of certain 
				circumstances and that not all senses are right for all things that they do. </li>
