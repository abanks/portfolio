	<h2>What I Learned Today 6/27/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>Some similarities between Python and Scratch is the use of Varibles, Boleens,
				Integers, Floats, and Strings. Some differences is that in Python syntax 
				and indentation are very crucial to the coding process, but when doing 
			scratch, its only drag and drop with variables that you would want to use. </li>
			<li>During my time coding today, I did have to debug a lot of different problems
				and it felt quite annoying that I couldn't really pinpoint the causes of errors quickly. </li>
			<li>I mainly just likes when my things worked correctly. It wasnt really hard, just very time consuming. </li>
      		</ul>
