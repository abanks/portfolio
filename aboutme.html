	<h2>Scratch Scrollable Game</h2>

	<h2>What I Learned Today 6/27/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>Some similarities between Python and Scratch is the use of Varibles, Boleens,
				Integers, Floats, and Strings. Some differences is that in Python syntax 
				and indentation are very crucial to the coding process, but when doing 
			scratch, its only drag and drop with variables that you would want to use. </li>
			<li>I mainly just likes when my things worked correctly. It wasnt really hard, just very time consuming. </li>
      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 6/30/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>A list in python is a way to organize things as well as making it easier for people to capture information and display it. </li>
			<li>During my time coding today, I did have to debug a lot of different problems
				and it felt quite annoying that I couldn't really pinpoint the causes of errors quickly. </li>
      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/5/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> Something that makes me nervous about the future of robots is that they're starting to be more independent with what actions
				that they do and i'm just wondering how much more independent they will get and what functions they will be able to do 
				without human input.</li>
      		</ul>
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/6/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> Both Manuela Veluso and Ayanna Howard both went to Georgia Tech. The Basic part of the Arduino sketch would be the power,
			ground, resistor, and the LED light.</li>
      		</ul>		 
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/7/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> I learned that the internet is something that consists of a lot of different components and without at least one of those 
			components things wont be able to get done.</li>
			<li> I would think that LaTeX i0s a markup language due to it beng used for formatting and it being used to write 
			math anc CS text</li>
      		</ul>		
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/10/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>I already had previous knowledge of circuits before starting these projects so i didn't really learn anything new, but it 
				was a nice refresher when we got to go over everything all over again.  </li>
			<li>My favorite part of the dance was making it kind of go with the song and just choosing what the robot did overall.  </li>
			<li> The kind of outputs that Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need both analog digital outputs for their robots. </li>
      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/11/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> *ADD PICTURE OF CODE AND ROBOT*   </li>
			<li>Our group worked pretty well together due to all of us contributing with both coding the robot as well as building the 
				robot itself.  </li>
      		</ul>	
	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/12/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> I feel like i understood downloading the different components that make up the django framework. </li>
			<li> I would probably like more practice using the account part of it, i would like to learn more about that and how it works in general. 
</li>
			<li> I would probably like to add more color etc. </li>
			<li>You could potentially create any website with it as long as you need a framework like Django.</li>
			 
      		</ul>	
<h2>What I Learned Today 7/13/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> As i said previously, i would like to add more color and things like that to my Django site.</li>


      		</ul>	
<h2>What I Learned Today 7/17/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> A lot of information is out there about me not only because I put my information into sites and google and things like t
				hat but also because different companies also sell our information to other companies for money. </li>
			<li>A programer can protect information by simply just securing the website better from hackers. </li>
			<li> These women keep peoples information private by coding like a somewhat safehouse around the information
				that people can no longer get into easily.  </li>


      		</ul>	
<h2>What I Learned Today 7/18/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> I found  it interesting that you can take data like this and make it interesting and colorful and easy to work 
				with. </li>
			<li> I think that computers are good with data because theyâ€™re constantly in contact with a stream of updated 
				information. 
</li>


      		</ul>	

	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/19/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li> Our team is dividing the
 work by just what we find and then once we do that 
we just inform the other groupmates. We make sure that
				we complete these tasks by just keeping each other accountable.</li>


      		</ul>	
<h2>What I Learned Today 7/25/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>One skill that i can build to help me become a better leader is to just 
				be more assertive i guess, but also to listen to feedback and use it accordingly.</li>

			<li>Like i said previously, I think that mainly I need to learn how to 
take feedback and use it instead of just hearing it and carrying on with
				my work.</li>

			<li>I think that I can check on my improvement by one, asking my groupmates
				as well as just checking the feedback that they had given me and see if my work reflects that.</li>

			<li>Our team is dividing up the work by webpages and we each have the opportunity
				to format our own pages.</li>

			<li>We chose to split it up that way so that each of us had something big, but not too big to handle.</li>

			<li>I individually am responsible for the webpage that displays the companies that we will be working with.</li>

			<li>I will be sure that I complete these tasks by making sure that each day that we have a deadline and that 
				we meet that we meet those deadlines. </li>

      		</ul>	
	<h2>What I Learned Today 7/28/17:</h2>
		<ul>
  			<li>I personally am pretty on track with the goals that I made earlier this week
and i think that im continuing to keep myself busy and productive and im glad
				about that beacause I honestly thought that woas going to be tough for me.</li>

			<li>i think that in order to keep myself on track i need to write down what i need to do and 
				continue to cross them out when im done.</li>

			<li>I now think that my goal is to finish looking up jobs and filling out the templates. I also need to 
				add the companies logos to the website and have it work properly.</li>
